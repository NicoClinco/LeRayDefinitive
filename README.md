Evolve-filter-relax algorithm approach to filter the Navier-Stokes equations.

1) Compile the library "Indicator Function"

2) Compile the application "LeRayApp"

3) The tutorial folders : DC_Test and TB_Test contains three subfolders:
   - A subfolder for the linear model
   - A subfolder for the gradient-type model
   - A subfolder for the deconvolution-based model
  Note : in each test case the type of filter that you want to use must be specified in constant/turbulenceProperties
  
  In order to set the initial conditions launch the script "setTotalFields" and then launch the applications
